    <p>
      With an urge to take handcrafted finesse to a new high, inspired by the the rich 
      culture &amp; poetic verses of India, trained in Fashion Luxury at the <em>Creative Academy, 
      Milan</em> &amp; <em>NIFT, New Delhi</em>, Mrinalini Chandra worked at <em>Tanishq (New Delhi)</em> 
      and <em>MontBlanc (Germany)</em> before launching her own label in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working on custom projects relating to multiple facets of design, the designer is best known 
      for her strikingly unique ideas, beautifully translated to three-dimensional products.
      Her strength lies in handcrafting brilliance combined with modern aesthetics. Her training at the 
      fashion capital of the world, <em>Milan, Italy</em> has given an edge to her design sensibilities. 
      However, the aspect of a glorious rendezvous with remains of history, from a very early 
      age in India, always reflects in her work and expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrinalini's creations can be defined as an eclectic range of whimsical, slightly 
      modern, slightly ancient, Jewellery Couture and High Fashion Accessories.
