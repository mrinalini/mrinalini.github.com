      Imagine you are on a vacation and all you want to do is pick up a book and read on
    ￼ a hammock all day long, overlooking a beach. It’s the sound of a perfect break, a fresh
    ￼ <em>sigh!</em> A content smile. You collect a few pebbles on your way back and save them 
      as keepsakes.
    </p>
    <p><em>
      We want to collect what gives us lightest joys. It takes us to happiness. Everyone 
      has these little moments/fantasies/dreams stocked for life in his/her aspiration jar.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      It might be of moments pre-lived or moments aspired. It could be the very day dream 
      or a treasured desire.
    </p>
    <p><em>
      The sudden rush, THAT little moment that holds your breath till you are back from the 
      little escape, revisiting your secure little world in your memories\dreams.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      It’s about understanding what is precious to you and why and how it needs to be protected. 
      How your secret needs to live untold. How it lives a 100 lives in your house. Between your 
      books, embroidered on your pillow, sown in your collar, jewelled in your ring, so on.. It 
      is about that emotion that you want to reflect about YOU, through what you carry on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Jewellery should be yours alone and nobody else’s. Talk to you while swinging by your 
      ears or wrapped around your wrist. It’s your proud ensemble. It invites thoughts about you. 
      It’s a conversation starter. It is the reason why you ended up buying the new attire. The shoes. 
      The Car .Oh, just as well the Entire House! It is your whole world till everyone has seen it 
      and then off course, you move on to another such magic creation. You don't let go of it still.. 
      You pass it on to someone you think will value it.. It’s a Classic. :)

      It could belong to a gypsy nomad who impulsively shot a pair of shooting stars and wore 
      them in her tangled braid all her life or a Genius Banker who calculates every single minute 
      and plans the folds on her skirt while you think she is indulging in casual talks.

    <p>She who owns it must day dream, think, Love and indulge.</p>
