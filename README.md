====================

This is the personal site of Mrinalini Chandra.


# Tools used for development
This site has been developed mainly in HTML, CSS and Javascript. jQuery and a few plugins have been used for the necessary client-side functionality. Jekyll has been used as a template engine and since it powers github pages, deployment is a breeze.

# Deployment
To deploy, all that is needed is a commit to the master branch in git and push to github server. Github runs jekyll automatically on the server to generate the website.

# Development
Since Jekyll is based on Ruby, Ruby needs to be present on a developer's machine. 
Jekyll can be run on server mode as `jekyll --server --auto` to get a server running on `localhost:4000`.
